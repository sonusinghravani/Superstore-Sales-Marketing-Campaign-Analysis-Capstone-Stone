### 2️⃣ Machine Learning & Model Improvement

#### 🔎 The Challenge
The dataset was imbalanced:
- Only 14.91% customers accepted the offer

#### 🌲 Baseline Model (Random Forest)
- Accuracy: 85.86%
- Recall (Buyers): 26%
- Problem: Poor identification of actual buyers

#### ⚙️ Solution: SMOTE
Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**

- Recall improved from **26% → 44%**
- Better targeting capability
- More useful for marketing campaigns

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

- 🎓 **VIP PhD Campaign**  
  Target PhD & Master's customers with early-access offers  

- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Family-Centric Bundles**  
  Create “Family Gold Pack” focused on Meat & Fruits  

- ⏳ **Recency Strategy**  
  Prioritize customers who purchased recently  

- 🌐 **Digital Conversion Strategy**  
  Convert 1,563 in-store shoppers to web platform users  

---

##  ⚠️ Note: Accuracy was not considered a reliable metric due to class imbalance. 
Recall and confusion matrix were prioritized to measure real buyer identification.

---

## 🎯 Business Impact
By improving buyer recall from 26% to 44%, the marketing team can 
identify 69% more potential buyers compared to the baseline model.
